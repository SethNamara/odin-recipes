    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        We have determined the nutritional value of oil for frying based 
        on a retention value of 10% after cooking. The exact amount may 
        vary depending on cook time and temperature, ingredient density, 
        and the specific type of oil used.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ cup margarine</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>In a heavy deep skillet or deep-fryer, heat oil to 360 degrees
            F (180 degrees C). Oil should be about 1 1/2 inches deep.
        </li>
        <li>In a medium saucepan, heat water and margarine to a rolling boil.
            Combine the flour and salt; stir into the boiling mixture. 
            Reduce heat to low and stir vigorously until the mixture forms a ball, 
            about 1 minute. Remove from heat and beat in the eggs one at a time. 
            Spoon the mixture into a pastry bag fitted with a large star tip. 
        </li>
        <li>Carefully squeeze out 4 inch long strips of dough directly into the hot oil. 
            Fry 3 or 4 strips at once, until golden brown, about 2 minutes on each side. 
            Remove from hot oil to drain on paper towels. Stir together the sugar and cinnamon; 
            roll churros in the mixture while still hot. </li>
    </ol>
